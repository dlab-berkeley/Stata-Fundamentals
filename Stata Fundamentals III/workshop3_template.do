* Day 3

* Outline:
* I. 	APPENDING & MERGING
* II.	RESHAPING	
* III.	MACROS
* IV.	LOOPS
* V. 	EXPORTING RESULTS

**************************************************

*Setting do-file basics:
//We want to set a "global" like the one below, to store the file path to today's data
global mycomp "/Users/isabellecohen/Dropbox/DLab/Stata Fundamentals III/"
// for my computer


//To set yours, manually open the data called "round1.dta" from your computer
//Do not use the stata menu; instead, find the file in your files, and double-click to open it
//Then run:
global mycomp : pwd

* "I want to give my file path the following name: mycomp" 

//Check if it worked
display "$mycomp"

* "Show me what the name "mycomp" represents" 

cd "$mycomp"



**********************************************
* I. 	APPENDING & MERGING
**********************************************

*APPEND DATASETS

*Data for round 1

clear all 
use nlsw88.dta, clear


count // how many observations in this dataset?
sum idcode // what is the range of family id numbers in this dataset?
br // let's browse the data




* Data for round 2,

use nlsw88_wave2.dta, clear

count // how many observations in this dataset?
sum idcode // what is the range of family id numbers in this dataset?
br // let's browse the data


// how many observations should we have if we combine them?

* Append the data

use nlsw88.dta, clear
append using nlsw88_wave2.dta

count // Do we have the correct number of observations?
sum idcode // Do we have all the expected ids?
br // let's browse the data


save nlsw88_wave1and2.dta, replace



* MERGE DATASETS

* Data for wave 1 
use nlsw88_wave1and2.dta

isid idcode // check if id makes  a unique identifier
duplicates report idcode 


*Lets look at the second part of the dataset
use nlsw88_childvars, clear

count 
des // let's see how many variables are in this dataset
isid idcode // check if id makes  a unique identifier
duplicates report id // another way of checking if the combination of nr and year is unique

* Merge
use nlsw88_wave1and2.dta, clear

merge 1:1 idcode using nlsw88_childvars //one-to-one merge

*What does it mean to have different _merge values?
tab _merge
*What should we do with these observations?

count
des // how many variables should we have, including the new stata-created _merge variable?
br
rename _merge _merge_1 //rename _merge so you can merge again later w/o error

drop _merge_1 //or drop merge

save nslw88_complete.dta, replace




**********************************************
* II. 	RESHAPING
**********************************************

*Load data
use nslw88_complete.dta, clear

//Some of this data is in "wide" format
list idcode childage1 childage2 childage3 childage4 in 1/10  //print the data to the screen

//First, we want to try and reshape it to "long" format
//Now, each row will be not a single individual, but an individual-child
reshape long childage, i(idcode) j(childidcode) 

list idcode childage in 1/10 //print again

/* Now take this data, and put it back into "wide" format

Right now, the data is organized at the individual-child level
That means that each observation represents a child
Instead, let's put the data at the individual level, so each row is one family

Note that we need to specify i() and j() after the comma
i() is the variable the data will be at the level of
j() will be how we're reshaping it*/

//COMMAND:







**********************************************
* I. 	APPENDING & MERGING - EXTENSION
**********************************************
//We could also have started by reshaping nlsw88_childvars, then done a many-to-one merge

use nlsw88_childvars, clear

//Let's first reshape nlsw88_childvars to long format
//COMMAND:




//Now we merge in the full dataset using what's called a many-to-one merge

merge m:1 idcode using nlsw88_wave1and2


**********************************************
* III. 	MACROS
**********************************************

//Imagine you want to do some analysis on our NLSW data
use "$mycomp/nslw88_complete.dta", clear

*LOCALS

local i=1
disp `i'
disp "The local called i has the value `i'"
//Now we increase i by 2.
local i=`i'+2
disp "The local called i now has the value `i'"

summ hours child_num
return list

//Calculate the ratio of hours worked to number of children
summ hours
return list
local hours=r(mean) // store the average in a local

summ child_num
return list
local child_num=r(mean) // store the average in a local

local ratio=round(`hours'/`child_num',.001)
disp "The ratio of hours worked to number of children is `ratio'"

//Let's check the math
disp 37.23/2.08

//There are a number of built in commands Stata can use to make locals
local ttl_exp_lab: var label ttl_exp
display "The variable label for ttl_exp is `ttl_exp_lab'."

//Use the --help extended_fcn-- file to make a local containing the format of ttl_exp 
//COMMAND:

local randomword : format ttl_exp
display "The format of ttl_exp is `randomword'."


*GLOBALS

//Considered bad form in programming, use sparingly.
//Easy list of long set of variable names
//Set the file path name for different computers

//We set up a global at the beginning of this do file, which can be very useful
display "$mycomp"



**********************************************
* IV. 	LOOPS
**********************************************

*FOREACH LOOPS

reg wage grade
reg ttl_exp grade
reg hours grade


//This will do the exact same thing
foreach var in wage ttl_exp hours {
	reg `var' grade
}

//var is just a placeholder, it could be anything
//Try it yourself! Use another word in place of var.
//COMMAND:






//Instead of using foreach fudge in, we can also use foreach fudge of
//This works only with variables
foreach fudge of varlist wage ttl_exp hours {
	reg `fudge' grade
}

/*You may notice that the output from inside a loop is not
quite as well documented as from outside a loop
It can be helpful to add display lines explaining where the code is*/
foreach fudge in wage ttl_exp hours {
	disp "********This regresses `fudge' on grade **********"
	reg `fudge' grade
}

//Regress each of the below outcome variables individually on grade, using a loop
//Control for the respondent's age, using the variable age
//Outcomes: wage ttl_exp hours tenure

//COMMAND: 





/*When running a long loop, you may want to turn off the --more-- command
This can be done with --set more off--
To do it permanently, you can run --set more off, permanently--*/

/*You can also use the command --set trace on-- to display 
EVERYTHING that goes on when you run a command
This should probably be a last resort, and can be turned off with --set trace off-- */

set trace on
foreach var in wage ttl_exp hours {
	reg `var' grade
}

set trace off

*FORVALUES LOOPS

//What if you want to loop over numbers?
foreach X in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 {
	disp "The number is `X'
}
//That works, but it's better to do forvalues
forvalues X=1(1)10 {
	disp "The number is `X'."
}

//Now set up a loop to display 1 to 9, display only odd numbers.
//COMMAND: 




//You can even loop over numeric values in variable names
forvalues x=1/4 {
	summ childage`x'
}

//loop over a list
local outcomes wage ttl_exp hours

foreach var of local outcomes {
	reg `var' grade
}

//Define a list of the outcome variables below, then loop over them
//Outcomes: wage tenure
//COMMAND: 




* NESTED LOOPS

forvalues X=1/10 {
	forvalues Y=1/10 {
		disp "X is `X' and Y is `Y' and X*Y is "`X'*`Y'
	}
}

//Control for the age of a different child in each regression

local outcomes wage ttl_exp hours
local i=1 //add an index so we can see how many regs we're doing
foreach var of varlist `outcomes' {
	forvalues x=1/4 {
		display "Regression `i':We're regressing `var' on grade, controlling for child age `x'"
		local i=`i'+1
		reg `var' grade childage`x'
	}
}

//Now run two versions of each regression, one with additional controls and one without
//Include the following variables as controls 
//Controls: south married union
//How might you keep track of what's going on within the loop?
//COMMAND: 




**********************************************
* V. 	EXPORTING RESULTS
**********************************************

//Create a folder to store output
//the mkdir folder creates the folder specified in " " (if the file path makes sense)
//cap, or capture, is a Stata command which tells Stata to keep going even if it can't implement that command

ssc install outreg2
