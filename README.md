# stata-fundamentals
For use in Stata workshops and intensives, as of May 2015.

Materials by [Garret Christensen](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~garret/dlab/index.html).

Certain command references need to be updated for current versions of Stata (e.g. Stata 13), such as "order" rather than "move" and "export delimited" rather than "outsheet".
